    "The function `extract_audio_segment` extracts a segment from an audio file based on specified start and end times in milliseconds. The steps are as follow:\n",
    "1. Loads the audio file using `torchaudio`.\n",
    "2. Converts the start and end times from milliseconds to sample indices.\n",
    "3. Extracts the audio segment corresponding to the specified time range.\n",
    "4. Returns the extracted audio segment as a `torch.Tensor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    "- `audio_file_path` (str): Path to the audio file.\n",
    "- `start_time_ms` (int): Start time in milliseconds.\n",
    "- `end_time_ms` (int): End time in milliseconds.\n",
    "- `sample_rate` (int): Sample rate of the audio file.\n",

    "## Word Error Rate (WER)\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Error Rate (WER) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of speech recognition systems. It measures the accuracy of a transcribed text compared to a reference (or ground truth) transcript by quantifying the number of errors in the predicted transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WER Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "WER is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{WER} = \\frac{S + D + I}{N} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- **S** is the number of substitutions (words that are incorrect in the prediction).\n",
    "- **D** is the number of deletions (words that are missing in the prediction).\n",
    "- **I** is the number of insertions (words that are extra in the prediction).\n",
    "- **N** is the total number of words in the reference transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WER = 0%**: Perfect match between the predicted transcription and the reference transcript.\n",
    "- **WER > 0%**: Indicates some level of error; a higher WER signifies poorer performance of the transcription system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference transcript is \"Hello world\" and the predicted transcript is \"Hello there\", the errors are:\n",
    "- **Substitutions**: \"world\" â†’ \"there\" (1 substitution)\n",
    "- **Deletions**: None\n",
    "- **Insertions**: None\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, WER = \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\) or 50%, since there are 2 words in the reference transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "WER provides a quantitative measure to compare different speech recognition systems or models, and to assess their performance in understanding and transcribing spoken language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate WER:**\n",
    "   - `wer_score = wer(true_transcriptions, predicted_transcriptions)` computes the WER using the `jiwer` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print WER Score:**\n",
    "   - `print(f\"Word Error Rate (WER): {wer_score}\")` outputs the WER score to the console.\n"
