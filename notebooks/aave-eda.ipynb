    "\n",
    "African American Vernacular English (AAVE), also known as African American English (AAE) or Black English, is a distinctive dialect of English spoken primarily by African Americans. It has its roots in the linguistic legacy of African slaves brought to the United States, blending elements of West African languages with English. AAVE is characterized by unique grammatical, phonological, and syntactic features, such as the use of double negatives, the dropping of consonant clusters, and a specific set of verb tenses. Although often stigmatized and misunderstood, AAVE is a legitimate, rule-governed variety of English with deep cultural and historical significance. It serves as a powerful tool of identity and cultural expression within the African-American community.\n",

    "Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) is a corpus of African American Language Varieties. The data set provides several hours of audio and transcripts from variety of communities. The UF Data studio has added much of the data set to HuggingFace [CORAAL Data Set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zsayers/CORAAL)."

    "### CORAAL:ATL (Atlanta, GA 2017; Version 2020.05)\n",
    "\n",
    "CORAAL:ATL consists of 13 primary speakers across 14 audio files, collected in 2017 and 2018 by Patrick Slay Brooks, a music producer in Atlanta ([www.slayinrecords.com](www.slayinrecords.com)), specifically for CORAAL. Speakers represent a modern friendship network in Atlanta, GA. Atlanta has been  described as a “black mecca\" in the South (Hobson 2010), especially in the context of the so- called reverse Great Migration, the movement of African Americans from Northern and Western cities back to the (urban) South. Brooks has a friendship group that highlights a diversity of experiences in Atlanta. Speakers range from being born and raised in Atlanta, to growing up in  places like New York City, Washington DC, and Los Angeles, CA. As with all sub-components,  see metadata for speaker details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speakers were interviewed by Brooks for CORAAL to fill a 2 x 2 demographic matrix. In file naming, like with CORAAL:PRV and CORAAL:ROC, the socioeconomic group is listed as “0” (e.g., ATL_se0_ag1_m_01_1) to denote no focus on socioeconomic groups (not to indicate a group lower than 1). We have attempted to capture and include in the metadata broad information about speakers’ demographic backgrounds, such as length of residence and other places lived, but leave questions of interpretation up to end users."
